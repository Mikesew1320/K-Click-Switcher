# K-Click Switcher by [Mikesew1320](https://t.me/Mikesew1320)

## Description

A simple script wrapper to switch the keyboard click sounds systemlessly using volume keys during installation. As simple as that!
Remember that this module contains the keyboard click sounds included in R-board Manager to make the usage fully systemless.

## How to submit or request sounds ?

If you want to submit or request another awesome keyboard click sound which is not included in the module yet, so you can contact me using my Telegram account below. 

## How to Uninstall ?

If you want to uninstall the module disable it from the Magisk Manager app or reflash the module again whether in TWRP or Magisk Manager.

## What can I do if I want to change my choice ?

If you want to change your choice again flash the module twice from TWRP or Magisk Manager then module becomes uninstalled in the first flash and you can choice again with the second flash.
